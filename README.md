# WhichPersonIsReal
There are 2 faces: a real and an AI-generated. Try to guess which is the real one.

App is an Android wrapper for http://www.whichfaceisreal.com. Many thanks to developers of this site.
App is much smoother than the website, adds cool image loading animations (https://github.com/tobiasahlin/SpinKit), there is no bug that loads real image first (like at the site).
